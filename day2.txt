Today i learnt about the basic operators and types in Kotlin :


### To add, subtract,divide we can use +,_,/ operators but we can also peform these calculations as follows:

--> to add 
    5.plus(4)

--> to multiply
    2.times(3)

--> to divide
    2.4.div(2)

## Also i came to know that Kotlin supports two types of variables: changeable and unchangeable. With val, you can assign a value once. If you try to assign something again, you get an error. With var, you can assign a value, then change the value later in the program.

##Strings 

Strings in Kotlin work pretty much like strings in any other programming language using " for strings and ' for single characters, and you can concatenate strings with the + operator. You can create string templates by combining them with values; the $variable name is replaced with the text representing the value. This is called variable interpolation.
